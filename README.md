# odin-recipes
This was my first html project where I demonstrated some foundational html concepts by creating a recipe page. Here I demonstrated
a use of lists, links, headers, images and the general html structure (boiler plate) This project was my first project while 
taking the TOP (the odin project) foundations course.
