    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of milk</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs with salt & milk until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
