    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons of unsalted butter (cut into thin slices) </li>
        <li>3/4 cups of buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of buttermilk (for brushing) </li>

        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. 
            Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender 
            until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.</li>
        <li>Fold the rectangle in thirds.
             Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. 
             Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.</li>
        <li>Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. 
            Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.</li>
        <li>Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. 
            Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
